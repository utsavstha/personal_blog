# Automate tasks with cronjobs

Cronjob can come in handy when you need your server to accomplish a repetitive task. For instance,
you may regularly run a given task at specific times during the day. This is useful for daily backups,
monthly log archiving, weekly file deletion to free up space, etc.
And if you use Linux as your operating system, you will utilize a cron job to accomplish this.

## What's a cron?

Cron is a work scheduling application found in Unix-like operating systems. The crond daemon works in
the background and allows cron functionality. cron reads crontab (cron tables) in order to execute predetermined scripts.
Using a special syntax, you may set cron jobs to automatically execute scripts and other tasks.

For individual users, the cron service examines the file:

```bash
/var/spool/cron/crontabs
```

## Cron jobs in linux

A cron job is any task that you schedule with crons. Cron jobs allow us to automate our hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly regular duties.

Now, let's examine how cron jobs function.

## How to Control Access to crons

In order for users to be able to add cron tasks, an administrator must enable the '/etc/cron.allow' file.

This message indicates that you do not have authorization to use cron.

Include John's name in '/etc/cron.allow' to allow him to utilize crons. John will now be able to create and modify cron tasks.

Users can also be denied access to cron job access by entering their usernames in the file

```bash
'/etc/cron.d/cron.deny'.
```

## How to Add cron Jobs in Linux

First, to use cron jobs, you'll need to check the status of the cron service. If cron is not installed, you can easily download it through the package manager. Just use this to check:

```bash
# Check cron service on Linux system
sudo systemctl status cron.service
```

### Cron job syntax

Crontabs use the following flags for adding and listing cron jobs.

- `crontab -e`: edits crontab entries to add, delete, or edit cron jobs.
- `crontab -l`: list all the cron jobs for the current user.
- `crontab -u username -l`: list another user's crons.
- `crontab -u username -e`: edit another user's crons.

When you list crons, you'll see something like this:

```bash
# Cron job example
* * * * * sh /path/to/script.sh
```

In the above example,

- `* * * * *` represents minute(s) hour(s) day(s) month(s) weekday(s), respectively.
- sh represents that the script is a bash script and should be run from /bin/bash.
- /path/to/script.sh specifies the path to script.

Below is the summary of the cron job syntax.

```bash
*   *   *   *   *  sh /path/to/script/script.sh
|   |   |   |   |              |
|   |   |   |   |      Command or Script to Execute
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   | Day of the Week(0-6)
|   |   |   |
|   |   | Month of the Year(1-12)
|   |   |
|   | Day of the Month(1-31)
|   |
| Hour(0-23)
|
Min(0-59)
```

Cron job examples

Below are some examples of scheduling cron jobs.

---

| SCHEDULE       | Description                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `5 0 * 8 *`    | At 00:05 in August.                                       |
| `5 4 * * 6`    | At 04:05 on Sunday.                                       |
| `0 22 * * 1-5` | At 22:00 on every day-of-week from Monday through Friday. |

:  
SCHEDULED VALUE: "At 00:05 in August." "At 04:05 on Sunday." "At 22:00 on every day-of-week from Monday through Friday."

It is okay if you are unable to grasp this all at once. You can practice and generate cron schedules with the crontab guru.

## How to set up a cron job

In this section, we will look at an example of how to schedule a simple script with a cron job.

- Create a script called date-script.sh which prints the system date and time and appends it to a file. The script is shown below:
- Make the script executable by giving it execution rights.

```bash
chmod 775 date-script.sh
```

- Add the script in the crontab using crontab -e.

Here, we have scheduled it to run per minute.

- Check the output of the file date-out.txt. According to the script, the system date should be printed to this file every minute.

# Wrapping up

Automating processes, such as via cron jobs, decreases the amount of repetitious effort required. It also enables robots to self-heal and operate nonstop without human intervention.

Linux relies heavily on cron tasks for automation, thus you should absolutely explore with crons.

Thank you for reading to the conclusion. Suggestions are always appreciated.
